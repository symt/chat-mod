# discord-chat-mod

## Setup

There are a few things that you have to do to set this up.

1. Download jar file from [here](https://github.com/symt/discord-chat-mod/releases)
2. Drop it in mods folder
3. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
4. Click "New Application" and proceed to type in a name for your application.
5. Go to the "Bot" tab and create a new bot.

From this, you will need 2 things: client_id (how people message you, in "General Information" tab) and your token (how discord knows who you are, in "Bot" tab). This will eventually change for ease of use, but not yet.

6. Go to https://github.com/symt/discord-chat-mod/issues and make a new issue requesting to be added to the discord server (necessary for talking/messaging people). Tag the issue as "request-access" and put your client_id in there (see above). This will be responded to shortly after it is created (within 24 hours).
7. Startup forge and join a server/world.
8. Run `/dtoken (ENTER YOUR TOKEN FROM EARLIER)`
9. Now that the bot is setup, you won't have to do this again unless you reset your client.
11. Now, using the discord username of another bot, type in `/dmsg (USERNAME) (MESSAGE)`. If there are multiple users with that name, you will have to use the tag (name#0000)

If you have any issues, please make sure to log an issue and I'll get back as soon as possible.
